# Updating Icon — Minecraft mod by theEvil4582

## 🧹 What it does
Deletes `icon.png` from your world folder after the server starts.  
Why? Because Minecraft insists on keeping outdated icons, and I don't.

## ⚙️ How it works
- Runs only in singleplayer (`IntegratedServer`)
- Hooks into `SERVER_STARTED` event via Fabric API
- No mixins, no reflection, no hacks — just clean Java

## 🧪 Tested on
- Minecraft 1.21.5
- Fabric Loader 0.17.2
- Fabric API 0.128.2
- Java 21+
  
Should also work on any version higher tho

## 🧠 Inspired by
The idea behind [Updating World Icon](https://modrinth.com/mod/updating-world-icon) by CursedFlames/Cursed1nferno
But for 1.21.5 and without mixins
